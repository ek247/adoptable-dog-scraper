Because of this we are looking for a very special home for her where she can live a calm and peaceful life.  She loves to snuggle and is very affectionate but also has a bit of independence to her and she is perfectly fine in her own space. She is growing to love her crate and now sleeps in it much of the day. On her short walks and in the apartment, she is curious and likes to cautiously explore her surroundings. She often makes several new human friends when we go outside. She has been extremely low maintenance, has not had a single accident and she immediately goes to the bathroom once outside.\n\nReba is 2 years old and looks like a Beagle Shepherd mix. She is fully grown at 29lbs, and she is up to date on all age appropriate medical care and microchipped.\n\nThis dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.

Bianca is an Olympic napper, with gold medals in binge-watching and low-key neighborhood walks. She's quite happy to meet new people, and will graciously allow everyone to pet her-especially essential workers carrying bags she can inspect for crumbs. She is completely unbothered by street noise, neighbor noise, and TV noise, loves belly rubs, ear scritches, car rides and, most of all, cream cheese. Her favorite spot in the house is on the floor, next to you-especially if you're in the kitchen. If you have furniture you want to protect, fret not- Bianca is content to be your canine footrest. She is more than full-grown at 59 lbs but once her diet and low impact exercise routine kicks in, we expect her to be a sturdy 42-45 lbs.

Juno is going to make the absolute best companion for his human - he is loving, loyal, eager to learn, and very curious. He hasn't had the most stable start in life, but he did come to Muddy Paws knowing a few commands and was clearly well-cared for physically.\n\nJuno is housebroken, although he had a handful of accidents while getting settled. With a regular schedule and crate training, he's doing wonderfully and definitely knows where the \"bathroom is! He settles quickly in his crate, although he loves being near his human and has those puppy dog eyes DOWN :). \n\nJuno is a very well-intentioned dog, but at 60 pounds is very powerful, and we would not recommend he go to a home with small children only because he might accidentally knock them over! With structure, consistency, and time, we are fully confident that Juno would eventually be a wonderful sibling to smaller humans.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of the city is a little overwhelming to Juno right now, but when he is inside or in his foster's backyard, he is excited, goofy, loves running around, and has about as much energy as you'd expect from a one year old! He knows sit, paw/other paw, and lay down, and is working hard at learning not to pull on a leash. \n\nJuno's foster mom has been gradually introducing him to the resident dogs, and we have only seen encouraging behavior (sometimes disinterest, sometimes appropriate levels of curiosity). We feel that Juno will do well with dogs and have seen nothing to indicate otherwise, but we always take dog-dog intros slowly just as a precaution! \n\nJuno will be a wonderful companion pup, and he can't wait to meet the family that will help him continue to put the time, effort, and training in to get him there!\n\nJuno is 1.5 years old and looks like a pit mix.

This two-year old Catahoula Leopard Dog mix has a beautiful black & brown brindle coat, white paws, a polka dotted chest, striking mocha-colored eyes, a bold white streak down her face, and a charming gap in her front teeth just like Kate Moss. Harlie is a complete snuggle bug and loves nothing more than hanging on the couch all day, watching Netflix, and giving an absurd amount of affectionate kisses with her oversize tongue. She is massively loving, gentle, and sweet with all humans she meets. Harlie is intelligent, inquisitive, and loyal... and just wants to be around her owner all day. Harlie appears mostly housebroken but has had one accident as she gets used to her new home. Harlie loves catching some vitamin D, going on long walks, and is perfect on the leash - never pulling, and walking directly besides her owner. While she dabbles in chicken jerky, Miss Harlie's favorite treat in the world is peanut butter; she dreams of a world in which PB comes out of all the faucets. Harlie can't wait to find her furever home in which you both binge on that show you missed in the 90s whilst downing pupaccinos and snuggling for hours.\n\nHarlie is 2 years old and looks like a catahoula mix.
